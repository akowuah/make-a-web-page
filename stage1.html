          <div class="topic-discussion">
            <br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.

          <br><br><b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
          <div class="topic-discussion">
            <br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.

          <br><br><b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
          <div class="topic-discussion">
            <br>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). For example, if you forget to close a &lt b &gt tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.

            <br>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up

          <br>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
              <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag <b>&lt p &gt</b> for example and a closing tag, <b>&lt /p &gt</b>. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <b>&lt br &gt</b> tag).

                <li><b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

                <li><b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lta href="www.udacity.com"&gt

        HTML is like a house with STRUCTURES/rooms; CSS is the STYLING that is added to the house.  There are RULES to follow when using HTML and TOOLS to help use HTML.
        One good way to review HTML is using chrome developer tools.  Developer tools is accessible by pressing f12 in chrome.  Websites have a tree-like structure.
        By clicking on elements of the tree, e.g. h1, img etc in google chrome developer mode, you can view more details about the elements such as pix size and border size of images.

        <b><br>How the browser knows:</b><br>
        <div class="topic-discussion">
          <b>HTML:</b>  HTML is the language of the internet.  The HTML language has specific rules that need to be followed just like typical languages have grammatical rules. HTML describes the structure and content of the webpage.  The building blocks of HTML is a “tag”.  The browser turns tags into elements. An element begins with a starting tag and end with an ending tag.  Everything between the tags is called content. The elements form a tree.
       
          <br><br><b>Tags</b> Each tag has a:
            <ol class="bullet-list">
             <li>name e.g. &lth1&gt.  The name tells us what kind of element will be created (e.g. a paragraph, block, image etc.)</li>
             <li>some have attributes with values e.g. &ltli class= “article”&gt</li>  
            </ol>
           
          <br><br><b>CSS:</b> CSS is another language.  It defines the style of a webpage e.g. size of font color, background, borders, positions etc.
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    
        <p class="independent">
        <br>To tie structure (i.e. HTML) and style (i.e. CSS), HTML must tell the browser what style to use and where to get it.
        
        <br> Once you understand the rules that govern how these languages work, you can look at an HTML code and get a pretty good understanding of how a webpage is laid out.

        <br><br><b>Note:</b> Everything on webpages are actually boxes square spaces.  We create boxes using the div tab.
